					Eric Shaub is an attorney who works with foreign nationals in the artistic fields of fine art, design, illustration,architecture and music to get them working visas and permanent residence in the United States. Our clientele includes visual artists, graphic designers, curators, architects, musicians, writers, and commercial and fine art photographers. Since 1994 Eric has helped thousands of artists obtain visas to live and work in the United States.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this website we will describe the O1 visa, the nonimmigrant option for artists, which is often known to those in the arts as the "artist's visa". We will also discuss the EB-1 category of immigrant visa (green card) based upon extraordinary ability.

				<p>
				Eric Shaub graduated from Cornell University in 1988 and Syracuse University College of Law in 1993. He is a member of the
				New York State Bar as well as the Federal Bar. While his clients are often individual artists who are trying to find a way to live
				and work in the United States, Eric has often worked with institutions including some of the best museums, art galleries and
				universities in the United States. With more than twenty years of experience with the exclusive focus on immigration for
				artists Eric has a wealth of practical experience having seen similar cases and circumstances in the past. Modern Painters
				Magazine and Bloomberg Business Week have interviewed Eric. He regularly works with clients throughout the US, Europe,
				Asia, Australia and South America. With Skype calls and reduced communication expenses clients can be half way around the
				world and still speak to Eric as if they were across the street.</p>
