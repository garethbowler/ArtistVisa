				<h4 class="textPeach">WHO CAN APPLY FOR O-1 VISA?</h4>
				<p>
					An O-1 visa is a nonimmigrant-working visa for aliens of extraordinary ability. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) classifies aliens in the arts as O-1B. To successfully apply for this visa, aliens in the arts should be <i><b>prominent</b></i> in their field. To establish prominence the artist (also known as the <i><b>beneficiary</b></i> of the petition) must have evidence of public acclaim and distinction. This includes published press about the beneficiary, or evidence of exhibitions or awards. Prominence is also established with recommendation letters from experts in their field, which will also support the beneficiary’s credentials in other ways.

				</p>
				<br>
				<h4 class="textPeach">VISA DURATION</h4>
				<i><b>How Long Can I Stay with an O-1 Visa?</b></i>
				<p>
					O-1 visas are issued for a maximum of three years. After that, O-1 visa status can be extended on a year-by-year basis. Beneficiaries can also apply at the U.S. Consulate in their country to extend their visas in three-year increments if they can show they have three years of new events scheduled.
					Successful applicants should be prepared to justify why they need to be in the U.S. for three years to complete an event (or series of events). A three-year itinerary of events will be prepared, and these events should be confirmed in writing. An example would be a letter from an art gallery that confirms that the artist will continually exhibit at the gallery over the three-year period.

				</p>
				<br>
				<h4 class="textPeach">PETITIONERS</h4>
				<p>
					<b>To apply for an O-1 visa a foreign national must have an employer in the U.S. or a U.S. agent as his or her petitioner.</b> Foreign nationals are not allowed to self-petition for an O-1 visa. You, the foreign national, are considered the beneficiary of a petition filed by someone else – your employer or U.S. agent.

				</p>
				<br>	
				<h4 class="textPeach">Employer <a href=""><img src="Icons/charticon-clay.png" class="charticon" alt=""></a></h4>
				<p>
				An <i>employer</i> agrees to pay you directly for your services, and in many instances the employer will withhold certain taxes from your earnings. This is a traditional employment relationship and works very well with professionals who are traditionally employed by a company, firm or institution. Examples include architects and museum curators.
				There are also instances where a company is a petitioner and the beneficiary is an independent contractor (where taxes are not withheld and the artist files his or her own taxes at the end of the year).
				Employment can be full-time or part-time. The employer can confirm a series of assignments at a specific rate, or it can confirm a range of assignments and even a range of rates. USCIS has been shown to be extremely flexible with their acceptance of a variety of relationships. But a key to successful application is having these confirmed assignments stretch over the entire duration of the visa period.</p>
				<br>
				<h4 class="textPeach">US AGENT<a href=""><img src="Icons/charticon-clay.png" alt="" class="charticon"></a></h4>
				<p>
				U.S. Agent A U.S. agent represents you in occupations where you have more than one employer or are receiving confirmed assignments from more than one entity. U.S. agents sometimes receive a fee or commission for representing the artist. Some professionals work with artist representatives. Commercial photographers, illustrators and musicians often have artist representatives. An artist representative can serve as a U.S. Agent—but not all U.S. agents are artist representatives. Some U.S. agents will solicit work for an artist (for example an artist representative) while other U.S. agents are not looking for additional work for the artist but are merely confirming the assignments with multiple entities that are required by the O-1 petition. It should be noted as well that there are instances where an employer could additionally serve as a U.S. agent, thereby allowing a direct employment relationship and also the ability to perform services for other entities.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Contract between artist and U.S. agent: The beneficiary (artist) and petitioner (U.S. agent) sign a written agreement detailing the terms and conditions of their U.S. agent-artist relationship.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Contract between artist and employers confirming the assignments in the U.S.: The companies that will be confirming the events with the artist will sign an agreement that will be submitted with the visa application. This agreement describes the work to be performed by the artist, rate of pay, number of projects per year, and other terms and conditions of the assignment. This agreement will also acknowledge that the artist is represented by an U.S. agent, and that this agent will represent both the artist and employer for work performed by the artist in O-1 status in the United States.

				</p>
				<h2 class="textPeach">Who Qualifies?</h2>
				<br>
				<h4 class="textPeach">DO YOU QUALIFY? <a href=""><img src="Icons/charticon-clay.png" alt="" class="charticon"></a></h4>
				<i><b>How Are You Extraordinary?</b></i>
				<p>
					Put simply, to qualify for the category of O-1B aliens in the arts applicants must demonstrate that they are prominent in their field. USCIS (Immigration) has a checklist of categories to satisfy this requirement. Being either nominated for or winning a major award, such as a Grammy, an Oscar, or an Emmy, satisfies this requirement. Barring that, the artist must satisfy 3 of the 6 following categories to demonstrate that they qualify:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Performed and will perform services as a lead or starring participant in productions or events that have a distinguished reputation, as evidenced by critical reviews, advertisements, publicity releases, publications, contracts or endorsements.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Achieved national or international recognition for achievements, as shown by critical reviews or other published materials by or about the beneficiary in major newspapers, trade journals, magazines or other publications.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Performed and will perform in a lead, starring or critical role for organizations and establishments that have a distinguished reputation, as evidenced by articles in newspapers, trade journals, publications or testimonials</li>
					<br>
					<li>Established a record of major commercial successes or critical acclaim, as shown by such indicators as title, rating or standing in the field, box office receipts, motion picture or television ratings and other occupational
					achievements reported in trade journals, major newspapers or other publications.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Received significant recognition for achievements from organizations, critics, government agencies or other recognized experts in the beneficiary’s field, with the testimonials clearly indicating the author's authority, expertise and knowledge of the beneficiary's achievements.</li>
					<br>
					<li>A salary or other remuneration for services that is high in relation to others in the field, as shown by contracts or other reliable evidence.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p>For the purposes of this overview we will summarize the relevant categories for you:</p>
				<br>
				<h4 class="textBlack">AWARDS</h4>
				<p>To satisfy this category you must have either won or been nominated for a major national or international award. The regulations mention Academy Awards, Emmys and Grammys. If you have won an award that is not at that level of a major national or international award then USCIS will most like consider that your award is insufficient for this category. Immigration will most likely not consider grants, residencies, or fellowships as satisfying the awards category. The current trend is that immigration rarely gives credit for the award category. On the other hand, evidence of grants, residencies and other awards are still very important because they help to show your significance.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4 class="textBlack">LEADING ROLE IN EVENTS</h4>
				<p>
					For this category you must prove that you have had a leading or starring role in events that are considered prestigious. You must also prove that you will be coming to the U.S. to have a lead or starring role in events that are considered prestigious. <br> <br>

					An event is something that occurs at a specific time. For example think of a performance in a concert, an artistic exhibition, a runway show, a lecture or a workshop. Judging the work of others can also be considered an event. Events can be documented as prestigious with articles about the event that mention the artist’s name. Press releases, invitation cards, catalogs and online mentions sometimes, but not always, prove that the event is prestigious. Promotional material about the event such as advertisements or posters can possibly prove that the event is prestigious. <br> <br>

					Most visual artists that are ready to apply for an O-1 have had multiple exhibitions, including solo and group shows. In the past, they could satisfy the events category with invitation cards and a press release about an exhibition. Now (and in recent years) USCIS also looks for clear evidence that the artist had an important role in the exhibition and that the exhibition was in some sense prestigious. <br> <br>
					
					To prove that the artist will have a leading role once they are in the U.S. we often look for press about the venue of the confirmed future event. For example, an art gallery that has been mentioned in the New York Times would be prestigious. We also look for press about the clients that the artist will work for (if the applicant is an art director, for instance). The key to this idea is to document that you are coming to the U.S. to do something and that there is some sort of evidence that this is prestigious. This can be accomplished by showing the venue is prestigious, that the actual event is prestigious or that the clients you will work with are prestigious.
				</p>
				<h2 class="textPeach">Preparations</h2>
				<h4 class="textPeach">THREE MAIN PARTS OF EACH O-1</h4>
				<i><b>1. You must have a petitioner.</b></i>
				<br>
				<i><b>2. You must have confirmed assignments for the term of the visa.</b></i>
				<br>
				<i><b>3. You must qualify for the visa.</b></i>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>
					As discussed above, each beneficiary must have a petitioner who will petition for his or her visa in the United States. The petitioner must confirm the assignments for the term of the visa; or the beneficiary must provide contracts with the additional employers who will work with the beneficiary if they have multiple employers in a U.S. Agent relationship. The beneficiary must demonstrate that they are extraordinary by having been nominated for or having received a major national or international award. Or they must demonstrate that they qualify for 3 of the 6 categories described above. (There is an additional category for “other comparable evidence.”) Strategy and Execution of Organizing the Evidence A critical component involves documenting an artist’s career so that their credentials clearly fit into the above listed categories. Some material already exists in the world. Examples of evidence that already exist would include press by or about the beneficiary, evidence of exhibitions or other events, and evidence of awards or other accomplishments. Often in reviewing an artist’s credentials Eric Shaub will make a determination of what supporting material should be prepared to bolster the material that already exists about the beneficiary. Letters of recommendation can be divided into three types
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4 class="textPeach">TYPES OF LETTERS</h4>
				<i>Types of Recommendation Letters</i>
				<p>
					<span class="sub-bold">CONFIRMATION LETTERS: </span>A confirmation letter can confirm an award if you do not have an award certificate or other proof that you received the award. It can also confirm a lecture you gave, a high fashion model’s participation in a runway show, or another type of event. These letters will be discussed with Eric on a case-by-case basis
				</p>
				<br>
				
				<p>
					<span class="sub-bold">CRITICAL ROLE OR CONTRIBUTIONS LETTERS: </span>The purpose of these letters is to confirm that you played a critical role with a person, organization, client or event. They can also confirm an artistic collaboration.
				</p>
				<br>
			
				<p>
					<span class="sub-bold">SIGNIFICANCE LETTERS: </span>These are letters from experts in your field who can attest to your significance in your field. While critical role letters will focus on the relationship between the artist and the writer of the letter, significance letters will be broader. They will describe the writer’s expertise and then offer an opinion about why the artist is significant in the industry. These letters will essentially describe all of the artist’s credentials and career to describe how the artist is prominent.
				</p>
				<br>
			
				<h4 class="textPeach">TRANSLATIONS <a href=""><img src="Icons/charticon-clay.png" alt="" class="charticon"></a></h4>
				<p>
					Translations The regulations regarding translations are quite clear. All evidence that is submitted must be submitted with a complete translation. All translations should be accompanied by a certification from someone who is fluent in both English and the original language. Before translating all articles or other evidence a consultation with Eric’s office can give guidance on what is important and needs translation, and what might be considered less important and would not make it into the final application.
				</p>
				<br>
			
				<h4 class="textPeach">NEXT STEPS <a href=""><img src="Icons/charticon-clay.png" alt="" class="charticon"></a></h4>
				<p>
					Next Steps Once the evidence has been obtained to document that the alien is extraordinary, and our firm is aware of whom the petitioner will be and the alien’s planned itinerary in the United States, we then prepare the forms and cover letters that immigration will need to approve the application. Often our firm needs time to organize the file. We then have the petitioner sign these documents and return them to us. We are then ready to send the file to immigration.

				</p>
				<br>
				
				<h4 class="textPeach">DECISION</h4>
				<p>
				 <i><b>Decision by USCIS: Approval, Denial or Request of Evidence</b></i> 
				 <br>

					When USCIS receives a file they can approve an application, they can deny an application or they can ask for more evidence. Requests for evidence from USCIS can ask for evidence to help clarify that the artist is in fact extraordinary or to seek clarification about what an artist will be doing in the United States. Once USCIS approves the petition they issue Form I-797 Approval Notice.
				</p>
				<br>
			
				<h4 class="textPeach">CONSULAR PROCESSING(O-1)</h4>
				<p>
					Consular Processing Our office will work with the artist on a consular form called DS-160. This application for the US State Department will ask for biographical information and will inquire about prior visas, and seek to uncover any problems that make an applicant ineligible for a visa. <br>
					Once the DS-160 has been prepared and generated our office will prepare a packet for the applicant that will include a copy of the petition, an updated letter from the petitioner, a copy of the DS-160 consular form with bar code and the Approval Notice I-797. Additional documents needed may include pay statements from past employers, old passports or other evidence of prior immigration status including I-20s, EAD cards and old approval notices. <br>
					In most instances applicants are required to schedule a personal interview at the consulate. This is often not an actual interview, but an in-person appearance at the consulate. Given the heightened border security measures currently under effect, the United States Consulates are on the defensive. They do not want to make a mistake, and the level of scrutiny on applications is at an all-time high. Our office is aware of this complication and we work intensively with all applicants to complete all relevant documentation. <br>
					Most often, the consular officer will take the passport and the related evidence and review it. The officer will then return most of the evidence and keep the passport. If the visa is to be issued, the passport is often sent back to the applicant by courier or mail in a period of time ranging from one day to three weeks, depending on the consulate and the time of year. <br>
					All applicants are screened for prior arrests and a terrorist watch list. If, as is sometimes the case, an applicant triggers a flag in the database search the consulate will not issue the visa until the issue is resolved. In the case of a mistake this may take a number of weeks or months. If you find yourself in this situation, we will work with you to attempt to resolve it. Through careful screening most issues can be identified at the beginning of the application process. In the case of a mistake, patience and persistence are our principle tools. While the consular sections can make mistakes, they are also fair and they will most often resolve them favorably. This is yet another reason to apply sooner. <br>
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4 class="textPeach">AFTER VISA ISSUED</h4>
				<p>
					<i><b>After Visa Issued From Consulate - Entering the U.S.</b></i> <br> <br>
					<span class="sub-bold">BORDER INSPECTION: </span>Our office advises applicants to take the entire packet that the applicant brought to the consulate with them on the plane in case U.S. immigration officials at the border have any questions about the visa. For example, they may ask about the artist’s credentials and ask what the artist will be doing in the U.S. for the petitioner.
				</p>

				U.S. Agent A U.S. agent represents you in occupations where you have more than one employer or are receiving confirmed assignments from more than one entity. U.S. agents sometimes receive a fee or commission for representing the artist. Some professionals work with artist representatives. Commercial photographers, illustrators and musicians often have artist representatives. An artist representative can serve as a U.S. Agent—but not all U.S. agents are artist representatives.

				<i><b>How Are You Extraordinary?</b></i>
				<p>
					Put simply, to qualify for the category of O-1B aliens in the arts applicants must demonstrate that they are prominent in their field. USCIS (Immigration) has a checklist of categories to satisfy this requirement. Being either nominated for or winning a major award, such as a Grammy, an Oscar, or an Emmy, satisfies this requirement. Barring that, the artist must satisfy 3 of the 6 following categories to demonstrate that they qualify:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Performed and will perform services as a lead or starring participant in productions or events that have a distinguished reputation, as evidenced by critical reviews, advertisements, publicity releases, publications, contracts or endorsements.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Achieved national or international recognition for achievements, as shown by critical reviews or other published materials by or about the beneficiary in major newspapers, trade journals, magazines or other publications.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Performed and will perform in a lead, starring or critical role for organizations and establishments that have a distinguished reputation, as evidenced by articles in newspapers, trade journals, publications or testimonials</li>
					<br>
					<li>Established a record of major commercial successes or critical acclaim, as shown by such indicators as title, rating or standing in the field, box office receipts, motion picture or television ratings and other occupational

					<li>Received significant recognition for achievements from organizations, critics, government agencies or other recognized experts in the beneficiary’s field, with the testimonials clearly indicating the author's authority, expertise and knowledge of the beneficiary's achievements.</li>
					<br>
					<li>A salary or other remuneration for services that is high in relation to others in the field, as shown by contracts or other reliable evidence.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p>For the purposes of this overview we will summarize the relevant categories for you:</p>
				<br>
				<h4 class="textBlack">AWARDS</h4>
				<p>To satisfy this category you must have either won or been nominated for a major national or international award. The regulations mention Academy Awards, Emmys and Grammys. If you have won an award that is not at that level of a major national or international award then USCIS will most like consider that your award is insufficient for this category. Immigration will most likely not consider grants, residencies, or fellowships as satisfying the awards category. The current trend is that immigration rarely gives credit for the award category. On the other hand, evidence of grants, residencies and other awards are still very important because they help to show your significance.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4 class="textBlack">LEADING ROLE IN EVENTS</h4>
				<p>
					For this category you must prove that you have had a leading or starring role in events that are considered prestigious. You must also prove that you will be coming to the U.S. to have a lead or starring role in events that are considered prestigious. <br> <br>

					An event is something that occurs at a specific time. For example think of a performance in a concert, an artistic exhibition, a runway show, a lecture or a workshop. Judging the work of others can also be considered an event. Events can be documented as prestigious with articles about the event that mention the artist’s name. Press releases, invitation cards, catalogs and online mentions sometimes, but not always, prove that the event is prestigious. Promotional material about the event such as advertisements or posters can possibly prove that the event is prestigious. <br> <br>

					Most visual artists that are ready to apply for an O-1 have had multiple exhibitions, including solo and group shows. In the past, they could satisfy the events category with invitation cards and a press release about an exhibition. Now (and in recent years) USCIS also looks for clear evidence that the artist had an important role in the exhibition and that the exhibition was in some sense prestigious. <br> <br>
					
					To prove that the artist will have a leading role once they are in the U.S. we often look for press about the venue of the confirmed future event. For example, an art gallery that has been mentioned in the New York Times would be prestigious. We also look for press about the clients that the artist will work for (if the applicant is an art director, for instance). The key to this idea is to document that you are coming to the U.S. to do something and that there is some sort of evidence that this is prestigious. This can be accomplished by showing the venue is prestigious, that the actual event is prestigious or that the clients you will work with are prestigious.

								<h4 class="textPeach">THREE MAIN PARTS OF EACH O-1</h4>
								<i><b>1. You must have a petitioner.</b></i>
								<br>
								<i><b>2. You must have confirmed assignments for the term of the visa.</b></i>
								<br>
								<i><b>3. You must qualify for the visa.</b></i>
								<br>
								<br>
								<p>
									As discussed above, each beneficiary must have a petitioner who will petition for his or her visa in the United States. The petitioner must confirm the assignments for the term of the visa; or the beneficiary must provide contracts with the additional employers who will work with the beneficiary if they have multiple employers in a U.S. Agent relationship. The beneficiary must demonstrate that they are extraordinary by having been nominated for or having received a major national or international award. Or they must demonstrate that they qualify for 3 of the 6 categories described above. (There is an additional category for “other comparable evidence.”) Strategy and Execution of Organizing the Evidence A critical component involves documenting an artist’s career so that their credentials clearly fit into the above listed categories. Some material already exists in the world. Examples of evidence that already exist would include press by or about the beneficiary, evidence of exhibitions or other events, and evidence of awards or other accomplishments. Often in reviewing an artist’s credentials Eric Shaub will make a determination of what supporting material should be prepared to bolster the material that already exists about the beneficiary. Letters of recommendation can be divided into three types
								</p>
								<br>
								<h4 class="textPeach">TYPES OF LETTERS</h4>
								<i><b>Types of Recommendation Letters</b></i>
								<p>
									<span class="sub-bold">CONFIRMATION LETTERS: </span>A confirmation letter can confirm an award if you do not have an award certificate or other proof that you received the award. It can also confirm a lecture you gave, a high fashion model’s participation in a runway show, or another type of event. These letters will be discussed with Eric on a case-by-case basis
								</p>
								<br>
				
								<p>
									<span class="sub-bold">CRITICAL ROLE OR CONTRIBUTIONS LETTERS: </span>The purpose of these letters is to confirm that you played a critical role with a person, organization, client or event. They can also confirm an artistic collaboration.
								</p>
								<br>
			
								<p>
									<span class="sub-bold">SIGNIFICANCE LETTERS: </span>These are letters from experts in your field who can attest to your significance in your field. While critical role letters will focus on the relationship between the artist and the writer of the letter, significance letters will be broader. They will describe the writer’s expertise and then offer an opinion about why the artist is significant in the industry. These letters will essentially describe all of the artist’s credentials and career to describe how the artist is prominent.
								</p>
								<br>
			
								<h4 class="textPeach">TRANSLATIONS <a href=""><img src="Icons/charticon-clay.png" alt="" class="charticon"></a></h4>
								<p>
									Translations The regulations regarding translations are quite clear. All evidence that is submitted must be submitted with a complete translation. All translations should be accompanied by a certification from someone who is fluent in both English and the original language. Before translating all articles or other evidence a consultation with Eric’s office can give guidance on what is important and needs translation, and what might be considered less important and would not make it into the final application.
								</p>
								<br>
			
								<h4 class="textPeach">NEXT STEPS <a href=""><img src="Icons/charticon-clay.png" alt="" class="charticon"></a></h4>
								<p>
									Next Steps Once the evidence has been obtained to document that the alien is extraordinary, and our firm is aware of whom the petitioner will be and the alien’s planned itinerary in the United States, we then prepare the forms and cover letters that immigration will need to approve the application. Often our firm needs time to organize the file. We then have the petitioner sign these documents and return them to us. We are then ready to send the file to immigration.

								</p>
								<br>
								
								<h4 class="textPeach">DECISION</h4>
								<p>
								  <i><b>Decision by USCIS: Approval, Denial or Request of Evidence</b></i>  
								 <br>

									When USCIS receives a file they can approve an application, they can deny an application or they can ask for more evidence. Requests for evidence from USCIS can ask for evidence to help clarify that the artist is in fact extraordinary or to seek clarification about what an artist will be doing in the United States. Once USCIS approves the petition they issue Form I-797 Approval Notice.
								</p>
								<br>
							
								<h4 class="textPeach">CONSULAR PROCESSING (O-1)</h4>
								<p>
									Consular Processing Our office will work with the artist on a consular form called DS-160. This application for the US State Department will ask for biographical information and will inquire about prior visas, and seek to uncover any problems that make an applicant ineligible for a visa. <br>
									Once the DS-160 has been prepared and generated our office will prepare a packet for the applicant that will include a copy of the petition, an updated letter from the petitioner, a copy of the DS-160 consular form with bar code and the Approval Notice I-797. Additional documents needed may include pay statements from past employers, old passports or other evidence of prior immigration status including I-20s, EAD cards and old approval notices. <br>
									In most instances applicants are required to schedule a personal interview at the consulate. This is often not an actual interview, but an in-person appearance at the consulate. Given the heightened border security measures currently under effect, the United States Consulates are on the defensive. They do not want to make a mistake, and the level of scrutiny on applications is at an all-time high. Our office is aware of this complication and we work intensively with all applicants to complete all relevant documentation. <br>
									Most often, the consular officer will take the passport and the related evidence and review it. The officer will then return most of the evidence and keep the passport. If the visa is to be issued, the passport is often sent back to the applicant by courier or mail in a period of time ranging from one day to three weeks, depending on the consulate and the time of year. <br>
									All applicants are screened for prior arrests and a terrorist watch list. If, as is sometimes the case, an applicant triggers a flag in the database search the consulate will not issue the visa until the issue is resolved. In the case of a mistake this may take a number of weeks or months. If you find yourself in this situation, we will work with you to attempt to resolve it. Through careful screening most issues can be identified at the beginning of the application process. In the case of a mistake, patience and persistence are our principle tools. While the consular sections can make mistakes, they are also fair and they will most often resolve them favorably. This is yet another reason to apply sooner. <br>
								</p>
								<br>
								<h4 class="textPeach">AFTER VISA ISSUED</h4>
								<p>
									<i><b>After Visa Issued From Consulate - Entering the U.S.</b></i> <br>
									<span class="sub-bold">BORDER INSPECTION: </span>Our office advises applicants to take the entire packet that the applicant brought to the consulate with them on the plane in case U.S. immigration officials at the border have any questions about the visa. For example, they may ask about the artist’s credentials and ask what the artist will be doing in the U.S. for the petitioner.
