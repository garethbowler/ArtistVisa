					<i><b>Legal Permanent Residency</b></i>
					<p>
						A green card holder is known as a Legal Permanent Resident (LPR) and has lawful immigrant status to reside in the United States.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are a number of ways that foreign nationals get immigrant visas (commonly known as Green Cards). Some will get the Green Card through marriage or another family relationship. Some will get it through employment, such as through a labor certification process. This firm processes Immigrant Visas under the category of Aliens of Extraordinary Ability. This is known as the EB-1 category.
					</p>
					<br>
				
					<h4 id="green-charticon" class="textGreen">EB-1 <a href="index.html#greenChart"><img src="Icons/charticon-green.png" class="charticon" alt=""></h4></a>
					<p>
						The EB-1 has two parts. The first part is always the same. It is called the I-140 or immigrant petition. The second part applies only if the first part is approved. Once the I-140 is approved the alien can either apply to adjust their status in the US, or they can apply to have an interview at a US Consulate. There are pros and cons for each option. Part I: The I-140 petition is necessary for preliminary approval. Part II: After the I-140 is approved the alien will obtain permanent residency one of two ways; Adjustment of Status or Consular Processing.
					</p>
					<br>
			
					<h4 class="textGreen">I-140 PETITION</h4>
					<i><b>Part I: the I-140 petition</b></i>
					<p>
						Extraordinary ability workers in the arts must demonstrate through evidence that already exists that they have achieved “sustained national or international acclaim” in their field of expertise, and that if they obtain LPR status in the United States that their work will substantially benefit the United States in the future. <br>
						Unlike Aliens in the Arts in O-1 status, a job offer is not required, and it is possible for a foreign national to submit a petition for a green card on her own behalf. However, she must intend to come to the United States to continue working in his or her field of extraordinary ability. For example, if a foreign national submits evidence to USCIS establishing that she is an internationally acclaimed curator, she must intend to continue to work as a curator once in the USA as an LPR.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4 id="standard" class="textGreen">STANDARD</h4>
					<i><b>Standard of extraordinary ability</b></i>
					<p>
						The standard to qualify for a green card based on extraordinary ability are higher than those for an O-1 visa. <br>
						While the standard for the O-1 is “distinction”, the standard for the green card is “sustained national or international acclaim.” This is a very high standard that allows USCIS much discretion about whether a case qualifies. <br>
						Moreover, a green card applicant must demonstrate that he or she attained a “level of expertise indicating that the individual is one of those few who have risen to the top” of the field of endeavor. <br>

						In order to qualify for the I-140 the applicant must satisfy two parts of a test:
						<ol>
							<li>Determine whether the petitioner or self-petitioner has submitted the required evidence that meets the parameters for each type of evidence listed at 8 CFR 204.5(h)(3); and</li>
							<br>
							<li>Determine whether the evidence submitted is sufficient to demonstrate that the beneficiary or self-petitioner meets the required high level of expertise for the extraordinary ability immigrant classification during a final merits determination.</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						If a petitioner has submitted the requisite evidence, USCIS determines whether the evidence demonstrates both a <i><b>“level of expertise indicating that the individual is one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of the[ir] field of endeavor,” </b></i>8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(2), and  <i><b>“that the alien has sustained national or international acclaim and that his or her achievements have been recognized in the field of expertise.”</b></i> 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3). Only aliens whose achievements have garnered “sustained national or international acclaim” are eligible for an “extraordinary ability” visa. 8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(1)(A)(i).

						The I-140 requires that the alien satisfy all three of the following:
						<br>
						<br>
						<ul class="list-styles">
							<li><span class="sub-bold">SUBPART A:</span> The alien must demonstrate that they have won a major international prize such as a Nobel Prize or else successfully prove that they satisfy three of ten categories of criteria.</li>

							<li><span class="sub-bold">SUBPART B: </span>The Alien must have substantial evidence about their career so that USCIS can make a determination about their application. The USCIS review is called the Final Merits Determination.

							<br>
							<li><span class="sub-bold">SUBPART C: </span>The alien must prove they are coming to the US to continue to work in their field and that they will not become a public charge.</li>

					<br>
					<h4 id="partA" class="textGreen">PART A: (3 OF 10)</h4>
					<h5 id="i-40"> <i> <b>I-40 Subpart A:</b> </i> </h5>
					<p>
						The first part of the test would require the applicant to be either the winner of a major international award such as a Nobel Prize, or she should provide documentation of three of the following ten categories to document Extraordinary Ability.
						<br>
						<br>
						<ul class="list-styles">
								<li>
									<span class="sub-bold">i. LESSER PRIZES OF AWARDS</span>
									<br>
									 <b>Documentation of the alien's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor;</b>The trend with this category is that USCIS wants very strong evidence that the prize is a national or international award. The trend is that the alien has to win the award (not just be a finalist) and that the award has to be national or international. Grants and Biennials are not considered good evidence for this category. If the documentation does not say either national prize or international prize somewhere in the documentation then USCIS will most likely not grant this category.
								</li>
								<br>
								<br>
								<li>
									<span class="sub-bold">ii. MEMBERSHIP</span>
									<br>
									<b>Documentation of the alien's membership in associations in the field for which classification is sought, which requires outstanding achievements of their members, as judged by recognized national or international experts in their disciplines or fields;<b>the trend here is a request for proof that the membership is very selective.

								</li>
								<br>
								<br>
								<li>
									<span class="sub-bold">iii. PRESS</span>
									<br>
									<b>Published material about the alien in professional or major trade publications or other major media, relating to the alien's work in the field for which classification is sought. Such evidence shall include the title, date, and author of the material, and any necessary translation;<b>This is probably the most important category since it also demonstrates evidence of sustained acclaim, toward proving the second part of the test. The recent trends are as follows: USCIS is being very strict about whether the press is in a major trade publication or major media. If something is regional at all they will most likely not consider this as strong evidence. Their preference is for scans of newspapers or magazines as opposed to the online version of the same. If the article is in a foreign language the article must be completely translated or it will not be considered by immigration. The article should be principally about the alien. Mentions of an artist as part of a group show will most likely not count. The trend is that immigration is looking for multiple articles and not just one article. The more articles that an alien has that fulfills all of this criteria the stronger the application. If an alien’s profession is in the arts and they do not satisfy these criteria then under the current standards of immigration it might not be worth applying at this time.
								</li>
								<br>
								<br>
								<li>
									<span class="sub-bold">iv. JUDGE OF OTHERS</span>
									<br>
									<b>Evidence of the alien's participation, either individually or on a panel, as a judge of the work of others in the same or an allied field of specification for which classification is sought;</b>Importantly there must be evidence that an alien actually participated as the judge. So, a letter inviting an artist to be a judge does not satisfy this category. On the other hand, if the alien has participated as a judge and this can be documented with evidence then this is a category that immigration often grants to aliens in the arts. If an alien is considering a green card application and they have not served in the capacity as a juror then this firm strongly recommends that the alien do this. Examples of jury membership can include: evidence of being on a jury for a competition in the field. We have also had success when an alien has served on a committee that gives out grants, or on a committee that selects artists for an artist residency.
								</li>
								<br>
								<br>
								<li>
									<span class="sub-bold">v. SIGNIFICANCE</span>
									<br>
									<b>Evidence of the alien's original scientific, scholarly, artistic, athletic, or business-related contributions of major significance in the field;</b>The trend is that no one gets awarded this category. In order to succeed the alien must prove their contribution is original. Think about it this way: is anyone writing textbooks about what you are doing? If not then you would most likely not qualify in this category.
								</li>
								<br>
								<br>
								<li>
									<span class="sub-bold">vi. SCHOLARLY ARTICLES</span>
									<br>
									<b>Evidence of the alien's authorship of scholarly articles in the field, in professional or major trade publications or other major media; </b>Scholarly articles are the type of articles that a professor publishes in a scientific journal. Articles that an art critic writes in a magazine do not satisfy this category. Similarly catalog essays do not satisfy this category. The questions to ask include: is the article published in a scholarly publication? Does the article have footnotes? USCIS has a strong “nose” for what is and is not a scholarly article. They have many applications by scientists and professors. They know what a scholarly article is. They will not give the benefit of the doubt if this article is not a legitimate scholarly article.

								</li>
								<br>
								<br>
								<li>
									<span class="sub-bold">vii. EXHIBITIONS AND SHOWCASES</span>
									<br>
									<b>Evidence of the display of the alien's work in the field at artistic exhibitions or showcases;</b> the adjudicative trend is that artists generally are granted this category. There has to be more than one exhibition to qualify. There should be substantial evidence to prove that the alien exhibited their work and that it was an artistic exhibition. This category generally does not work as well for musicians and fashion designers since immigration explains that concerts or fashion shows are what these professionals all do in their field as part of their day-to-day activity. That being said a professional artist with many shows would most likely qualify for this category, especially if there are a number of solo exhibitions. Evidence of Museum Shows, Art Biennials or high end gallery solo shows will also be stronger evidence to help with the second part of the test.

								</li>
								<br>
								<br>
								<li>
									<span class="sub-bold">viii. CRITICAL ROLE</span>
									<br>
									<b>Evidence that the alien has performed in a leading or critical role for organizations or establishments that have a distinguished reputation; </b>some occupations are more suited to this category then others. Any occupation where the alien has worked for an employer for many years would have a stronger chance of satisfying this category. For example, an architect or graphic designer, or a curator with a museum might be able to document a strong critical role with an organization. We have had success with artists who have gallery representation if we can prove the artist has had a leading role with that gallery by having multiple high profile exhibitions. One time exhibitions or one-time involvements will generally not succeed with this category these days.
								</li>
								<br>
								<br>
								<li>
									<span class="sub-bold">ix. HIGH REMUNERATION</span>
									<br>
									<b>Evidence that the alien has commanded a high salary or other significantly high remuneration for services, in relation to others in the field;</b> in some occupations, for example Art Directors in Ad Firms, the alien receives a salary. There are online surveys, which can document whether the salary is high compared to others. Artists can also get letters from their galleries if they earn a large amount from that gallery over time. One time payments or sales would most likely not satisfy this category.
								</li>
								<br>
								<br>
								<li>
									<span class="sub-bold">x. COMMMERCIAL SUCCESS</span>
									<br>
									<b>Evidence of commercial successes in the performing arts, as shown by box office receipts or record, cassette, compact disk, or video sales.</b> This category applies to musicians, movie stars, film directors and others whose work might appear on charts (Billboard 100 for example).
								</li>
							
								
							</ul>
						<b>If the above standards do not readily apply to the beneficiary's occupation, the petitioner may submit comparable evidence to establish the beneficiary's eligibility. </b>The adjudicative trend is that immigration will not give weight to this category unless the occupation does not suit itself to the above ten categories.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4 id="partB" class="textGreen">PART B: THE FINAL MERITS DETERMINATION</h4>
					<i><b>I-140 Part B: The Final Merits Determination</b></i>
					<br>
					<p>
						If you are able to show that you meet at least 3 of the above regulatory criteria, USCIS will then review all of the evidence in the record in its totality to determine if it is more likely than not that you have sustained national or international acclaim and are one of that small percentage who has risen to the very top of the field of endeavor. To satisfy the Final Merits Determination the alien should put their best application together so that immigration can review all of the evidence and approve the case. This part is relatively subjective and USCIS has great discretion in determining whether an alien is successful. The stronger the evidence is in terms of an alien’s achievements in the field compared to others, the more efficiently and accurately USCIS can process the petition. Ultimately it is this risk of failing the Final Merits Determination that can foil what would otherwise be a successful application. To some extent a letter or memo from the attorney can help explain why the alien qualifies to be approved. Realistically, however, the alien should understand that there is risk in this type of application and that even if they feel they clearly qualify in the I-140 part A they nevertheless could be unsuccessful in Part B.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4 id="partC" class="textGreen">PART C: FUTURE OFFERS I-140</h4>
					<p>
						The alien must prove they are coming to the US to continue to work in their field and that they will not become a public charge.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Evidence of Part C can include:</b> Letters from current or prospective employers; documents evidencing prearranged commitments (such as contracts); and a statement from the alien detailing their plans on how they intend to continue working in their field in the United States.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h2 id="ways" class="textGreen">Ways To Proceed</h2>
					<br>
					<h4 id="USCIS" class="textGreen">SEND FILE TO USCIS</h4>
					<i><b>Sending the file to USCIS</b></i>
					<p>
						When USCIS receives the file they will either approve the application, deny the application or ask for more information so that they can either approve or deny the application. The request for more information is called Request for Evidence. If the application is approved the applicant can continue to the second part of the application.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4 class="textGreen">UPON APPROVAL</h4>
					<i><b>After I-140 Petition is approved Part II:</b></i>
					<p>
						After the I-140 is approved the alien will obtain permanent residency one of two ways: Adjustment of Status or Consular Processing
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4 id="adjustment" class="textGreen">ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS</h4>
					<p>
						Adjustment of Status requires that the alien file the application while they are in the United States in valid non-immigrant status. That means you have to have an unexpired non-immigrant visa in order to file. If that is the case and you have an approved I-140 you should gather evidence that you always complied with your non-immigrant status. This means that for former students you must hold copies of all of your I-20s. If you had other visas such as O-1 visas you should have copies of all approval notices and all prior visas. The law allows adjustment of status when the applicant has never been out of status for even one day. It may be possible that a person is in valid O1 status but that at some point in the past they stayed in the US longer then they were allowed or had another type of status violation. Unless an applicant can document their entire O-1 status it is the opinion of this firm that they can suffer severe delays in finishing up the O1 process and in fact the process can ultimately be denied. Applicants who have been in the US for many years or for those that have not kept copies of all of their immigration paperwork should not attempt Adjustment of Status but should instead seek to process the second part of their visa at their home consulate. <br>
						An advantage of Adjustment of Status is that once the applicant files to adjust their status they no longer have their former status and now have the new status called “Pending Adjustment of Status.” So, for example, if an applicant has an O-1 visa that is expiring in March and they file their application a month earlier, in February, then they would not need to renew their O-1 visa status so long as they filed in a timely manner.
						<br>
						When an applicant files adjustment of status they file three applications. One application is called the application to adjust status. This is called the I-485. The other applications are called application for employment authorization I-765 and application for advanced parole I-131. Once these additional applications are processed the applicant will be free to travel outside of the US and work in the US for whomever they would like. Note that until the advanced parole card is received the applicant cannot travel outside of the US. If the applicant leaves the US before they receive their advanced parole document their application is considered abandoned. Note as well that there is a black out period of anywhere from 3-6 months from when an applicant filed their adjustment of status before they can normally travel. Thus applicants who have extensive travel commitments, or those who have relatives in poor health should not apply for adjustment of status but should instead apply for consular processing.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4 id="consular-processing" class="textGreen">CONSULAR PROCESSING (GREEN CARD)</h4>
					<i><b>Consular Processing</b></i>
					<p>
						The second option for finishing the green card process is called Consular Processing. The end result is an interview at the US Consulate in the home country of the applicant. Note that there is generally only one consulate per country that handles the applications. So, for example, in Germany all interviews are held in Frankfurt for immigrant visas. The process is as follows: After the approval of the I-140 (the first part of the application) USCIS will forward the application to the National Visa Center. The timing of this can range from one to three months but can take longer. After the National Visa Center receives the application they will make a fee request by email. The applicant will pay that fee from their bank account and can then move on to the next phase, which is submitting their DS-260 consular form and their civil documents. The civil documents will include documents such as: birth certificates, marriage certificates, divorce decrees, the birth certificates of any children, a copy of their passport biographical (photo) page as well as any evidence of military service. If the applicant has ever been arrested they will need evidence of the disposition of the arrest.
						<br><br>
						After submitting the civil documents and forms DS-260 the National Visa Center has to complete their processing and when the processing is complete they will notify the Consulate to schedule the interview. In general the processing time from USCIS approval of the I-140 until the immigrant interview is normally within the range of 6-8 months. The timing of receiving an immigrant visa after an interview can depend from consulate to consulate and is often a week after the interview. Once the applicant receives their immigrant visa they will pay an additional fee called the ELIS fee. This should be paid before the applicant enters the US. When the consulate issues the visa they also send out a sealed envelope. The applicant will take the unopened sealed envelope with the immigrant visa and will present that to the US CIS officer in the US. That officer will update the computer and stamp the passport. At that point the immigrant is a permanent resident of the US. The green card is only evidence of the status that has already been received. The card is sent in the mail often a month or so after entry into the US.
						One advantage of consular processing is that the timing is very predicable and is not often longer than that timeline. As opposed to adjustment of status, which can be 4 months but can be more than three years or longer on occasion, the consular processing timeline is very consistent.
						<br><br>
						It should be noted that for consular processing the applicant must maintain non-immigrant visa status until they leave the US to have their immigrant interview. An applicant can travel freely in and out of the United States so long as their current non-immigrant visa allows it, but the only time the benefit of this application accrues to an applicant is after the applicant returns as permanent resident. So, for example, an O-1 visa holder who has not yet been scheduled for their final interview may be faced with either extending their O1 visa in the US to maintain their status, or, in some instances, leaving the US to obtain one more O1 visa even though they might to scheduled for their immigrant visas a few months later. Under that scenario, an applicant can choose to move their immigrant visa interview at a later date, such as 6 months later.
						<br><br>
						Medical Exam: If the applicant is filing by adjustment of status they must have a medical exam from a Civil Surgeon on the approved list of USCIS. The medical exam will make sure the applicant is healthy and does not have an infectious disease. The doctor will give the applicant inoculations unless they can prove that they have already received the inoculations on the US CIS list.
						<br><br>
						If the applicant applies for consular processing the medical exam must take place before the interview. Depending upon the applicant’s travel plans they would need to have the medical exam on a prior trip to their country or they will need to travel to the country with enough time to process the medical exam before the interview.

								<i><b>Legal Permanent Residency</b></i>
								<p>
									A green card holder is known as a Legal Permanent Resident (LPR) and has lawful immigrant status to reside in the United States.
								</p>
								<p>
									There are a number of ways that foreign nationals get immigrant visas (commonly known as Green Cards). Some will get the Green Card through marriage or another family relationship. Some will get it through employment, such as through a labor certification process. This firm processes Immigrant Visas under the category of Aliens of Extraordinary Ability. This is known as the EB-1 category.
								</p>
								<br>
							
								<h4 id="EB-1-m" class="textGreen">EB-1<a href="index.html#greenChart-m"><img src="Icons/charticon-green.png" class="charticon" alt=""></h4></a> 
								<p>
									The EB-1 has two parts. The first part is always the same. It is called the I-140 or immigrant petition. The second part applies only if the first part is approved. Once the I-140 is approved the alien can either apply to adjust their status in the US, or they can apply to have an interview at a US Consulate. There are pros and cons for each option. Part I: The I-140 petition is necessary for preliminary approval. Part II: After the I-140 is approved the alien will obtain permanent residency one of two ways; Adjustment of Status or Consular Processing.
								</p>
								<br>
						
								<h4 id="i-40-m" class="textGreen">I-140 PETITION</h4>
								<i><b>Part I: the I-140 petition</b></i>
								<p>
									Extraordinary ability workers in the arts must demonstrate through evidence that already exists that they have achieved “sustained national or international acclaim” in their field of expertise, and that if they obtain LPR status in the United States that their work will substantially benefit the United States in the future. <br>
									Unlike Aliens in the Arts in O-1 status, a job offer is not required, and it is possible for a foreign national to submit a petition for a green card on her own behalf. However, she must intend to come to the United States to continue working in his or her field of extraordinary ability. For example, if a foreign national submits evidence to USCIS establishing that she is an internationally acclaimed curator, she must intend to continue to work as a curator once in the USA as an LPR.
								</p>
								<br>
								<h4 id="standard-m" class="textGreen">STANDARD</h4>
								<i><b>Standard of extraordinary ability</b></i>
								<p>
									The standard to qualify for a green card based on extraordinary ability are higher than those for an O-1 visa. <br>
									While the standard for the O-1 is “distinction”, the standard for the green card is “sustained national or international acclaim.” This is a very high standard that allows USCIS much discretion about whether a case qualifies. <br>
									Moreover, a green card applicant must demonstrate that he or she attained a “level of expertise indicating that the individual is one of those few who have risen to the top” of the field of endeavor. <br>
								</p>
								<br>
								<h4 id="evidence-m" class="textGreen">EVIDENCE</h4>
								<i><b>Evidence of Extraordinary Ability</b></i>
								<br>
								<p>
									In order to qualify for the I-140 the applicant must satisfy two parts of a test:
									<ol>
										<li>Determine whether the petitioner or self-petitioner has submitted the required evidence that meets the parameters for each type of evidence listed at 8 CFR 204.5(h)(3); and</li>
										<br>
										<li>Determine whether the evidence submitted is sufficient to demonstrate that the beneficiary or self-petitioner meets the required high level of expertise for the extraordinary ability immigrant classification during a final merits determination.</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
									If a petitioner has submitted the requisite evidence, USCIS determines whether the evidence demonstrates both a <i><b>“level of expertise indicating that the individual is one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of the[ir] field of endeavor,” </b></i>8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(2), and  <i><b>“that the alien has sustained national or international acclaim and that his or her achievements have been recognized in the field of expertise.”</b></i> 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3). Only aliens whose achievements have garnered “sustained national or international acclaim” are eligible for an “extraordinary ability” visa. 8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(1)(A)(i).

On the other hand, if the alien has participated as a judge and this can be documented with evidence then this is a category that immigration often grants to aliens in the arts. If an alien is considering a green card application and they have not served in the capacity as a juror then this firm strongly recommends that the alien do this. Examples of jury membership can include: evidence of being on a jury for a competition in the field. We have also had success when an alien has served on a committee that gives out grants, or on a committee that selects artists for an artist residency.

									<span class="sub-bold">v. SIGNIFICANCE</span>
									<br>
									<b>Evidence of the alien's original scientific, scholarly, artistic, athletic, or business-related contributions of major significance in the field;</b>The trend is that no one gets awarded this category. In order to succeed the alien must prove their contribution is original. Think about it this way: is anyone writing textbooks about what you are doing? If not then you would most likely not qualify in this category.
								</li>
								<br>
								<br>
								<li>
									<span class="sub-bold">vi. SCHOLARLY ARTICLES</span>
									<br>
									<b>Evidence of the alien's authorship of scholarly articles in the field, in professional or major trade publications or other major media; </b>Scholarly articles are the type of articles that a professor publishes in a scientific journal. Articles that an art critic writes in a magazine do not satisfy this category. Similarly catalog essays do not satisfy this category. The questions to ask include: is the article published in a scholarly publication? Does the article have footnotes? USCIS has a strong “nose” for what is and is not a scholarly article. They have many applications by scientists and professors. They know what a scholarly article is. They will not give the benefit of the doubt if this article is not a legitimate scholarly article.

								<br>
								<br>
								<li>
									<span class="sub-bold">vii. EXHIBITIONS AND SHOWCASES</span>
									<br>
									<b>Evidence of the display of the alien's work in the field at artistic exhibitions or showcases;</b> the adjudicative trend is that artists generally are granted this category. There has to be more than one exhibition to qualify. There should be substantial evidence to prove that the alien exhibited their work and that it was an artistic exhibition. This category generally does not work as well for musicians and fashion designers since immigration explains that concerts or fashion shows are what these professionals all do in their field as part of their day-to-day activity. That being said a professional artist with many shows would most likely qualify for this category, especially if there are a number of solo exhibitions. Evidence of Museum Shows, Art Biennials or high end gallery solo shows will also be stronger evidence to help with the second part of the test.

								</li>
								<br>
								<br>
								<li>
									<span class="sub-bold">viii. CRITICAL ROLE</span>
									<br>
									<b>Evidence that the alien has performed in a leading or critical role for organizations or establishments that have a distinguished reputation; </b>some occupations are more suited to this category then others. Any occupation where the alien has worked for an employer for many years would have a stronger chance of satisfying this category. For example, an architect or graphic designer, or a curator with a museum might be able to document a strong critical role with an organization. We have had success with artists who have gallery representation if we can prove the artist has had a leading role with that gallery by having multiple high profile exhibitions. One time exhibitions or one-time involvements will generally not succeed with this category these days.
								</li>
								<br>
								<br>
								<li>
									<span class="sub-bold">ix. HIGH REMUNERATION</span>
									<br>
									<b>Evidence that the alien has commanded a high salary or other significantly high remuneration for services, in relation to others in the field;</b> in some occupations, for example Art Directors in Ad Firms, the alien receives a salary. There are online surveys, which can document whether the salary is high compared to others. Artists can also get letters from their galleries if they earn a large amount from that gallery over time. One time payments or sales would most likely not satisfy this category.
								</li>
								<br>
								<br>
								<li>
									<span class="sub-bold">x. COMMMERCIAL SUCCESS</span>
									<br>
									<b>Evidence of commercial successes in the performing arts, as shown by box office receipts or record, cassette, compact disk, or video sales.</b> This category applies to musicians, movie stars, film directors and others whose work might appear on charts (Billboard 100 for example).
								</li>
							
								
							</ul>
							<br>
							<b>If the above standards do not readily apply to the beneficiary's occupation, the petitioner may submit comparable evidence to establish the beneficiary's eligibility. </b>The adjudicative trend is that immigration will not give weight to this category unless the occupation does not suit itself to the above ten categories.

								<h4 id="partB-m" class="textGreen">PART B: THE FINAL MERITS DETERMINATION</h4>
								<i><b>I-140 Part B: The Final Merits Determination</b></i>
								<br>
								<p>
									If you are able to show that you meet at least 3 of the above regulatory criteria, USCIS will then review all of the evidence in the record in its totality to determine if it is more likely than not that you have sustained national or international acclaim and are one of that small percentage who has risen to the very top of the field of endeavor. To satisfy the Final Merits Determination the alien should put their best application together so that immigration can review all of the evidence and approve the case. This part is relatively subjective and USCIS has great discretion in determining whether an alien is successful. The stronger the evidence is in terms of an alien’s achievements in the field compared to others, the more efficiently and accurately USCIS can process the petition. Ultimately it is this risk of failing the Final Merits Determination that can foil what would otherwise be a successful application. To some extent a letter or memo from the attorney can help explain why the alien qualifies to be approved. Realistically, however, the alien should understand that there is risk in this type of application and that even if they feel they clearly qualify in the I-140 part A they nevertheless could be unsuccessful in Part B.
								</p>
								<br>
								<h4 id="partC-m" class="textGreen">PART C: FUTURE OFFERS I-140</h4>
								<p>
									The alien must prove they are coming to the US to continue to work in their field and that they will not become a public charge.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Evidence of Part C can include:</b> Letters from current or prospective employers; documents evidencing prearranged commitments (such as contracts); and a statement from the alien detailing their plans on how they intend to continue working in their field in the United States.

								<h4 id="USCIS-m" class="textGreen">SEND FILE TO USCIS</h4>
								<i><b>Sending the file to USCIS</b></i>
								<p>
									When USCIS receives the file they will either approve the application, deny the application or ask for more information so that they can either approve or deny the application. The request for more information is called Request for Evidence. If the application is approved the applicant can continue to the second part of the application.
								</p>
								<br>
								<h4 class="textGreen">UPON APPROVAL</h4>
								<br>
								<i><b>After I-140 Petition is approved Part II:</b></i>
								<p>
									After the I-140 is approved the alien will obtain permanent residency one of two ways: Adjustment of Status or Consular Processing
								</p>
								<h4 id="adustment-m" class="textGreen">ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS</h4>
								<p>
									Adjustment of Status requires that the alien file the application while they are in the United States in valid non-immigrant status. That means you have to have an unexpired non-immigrant visa in order to file. If that is the case and you have an approved I-140 you should gather evidence that you always complied with your non-immigrant status. This means that for former students you must hold copies of all of your I-20s. If you had other visas such as O-1 visas you should have copies of all approval notices and all prior visas. The law allows adjustment of status when the applicant has never been out of status for even one day. It may be possible that a person is in valid O1 status but that at some point in the past they stayed in the US longer then they were allowed or had another type of status violation. Unless an applicant can document their entire O-1 status it is the opinion of this firm that they can suffer severe delays in finishing up the O1 process and in fact the process can ultimately be denied. Applicants who have been in the US for many years or for those that have not kept copies of all of their immigration paperwork should not attempt Adjustment of Status but should instead seek to process the second part of their visa at their home consulate. <br>
									An advantage of Adjustment of Status is that once the applicant files to adjust their status they no longer have their former status and now have the new status called “Pending Adjustment of Status.” So, for example, if an applicant has an O-1 visa that is expiring in March and they file their application a month earlier, in February, then they would not need to renew their O-1 visa status so long as they filed in a timely manner.
									<br>
									When an applicant files adjustment of status they file three applications. One application is called the application to adjust status. This is called the I-485. The other applications are called application for employment authorization I-765 and application for advanced parole I-131. Once these additional applications are processed the applicant will be free to travel outside of the US and work in the US for whomever they would like. Note that until the advanced parole card is received the applicant cannot travel outside of the US. If the applicant leaves the US before they receive their advanced parole document their application is considered abandoned. Note as well that there is a black out period of anywhere from 3-6 months from when an applicant filed their adjustment of status before they can normally travel. Thus applicants who have extensive travel commitments, or those who have relatives in poor health should not apply for adjustment of status but should instead apply for consular processing.
								</p>
								<br>
								<h4 id="consular-processing-m" class="textGreen">CONSULAR PROCESSING (GREEN CARD)</h4>
								<i><b>Consular Processing</b></i>
								<p>
									The second option for finishing the green card process is called Consular Processing. The end result is an interview at the US Consulate in the home country of the applicant. Note that there is generally only one consulate per country that handles the applications. So, for example, in Germany all interviews are held in Frankfurt for immigrant visas. The process is as follows: After the approval of the I-140 (the first part of the application) USCIS will forward the application to the National Visa Center. The timing of this can range from one to three months but can take longer. After the National Visa Center receives the application they will make a fee request by email. The applicant will pay that fee from their bank account and can then move on to the next phase, which is submitting their DS-260 consular form and their civil documents. The civil documents will include documents such as: birth certificates, marriage certificates, divorce decrees, the birth certificates of any children, a copy of their passport biographical (photo) page as well as any evidence of military service. If the applicant has ever been arrested they will need evidence of the disposition of the arrest.
									<br>
									After submitting the civil documents and forms DS-260 the National Visa Center has to complete their processing and when the processing is complete they will notify the Consulate to schedule the interview. In general the processing time from USCIS approval of the I-140 until the immigrant interview is normally within the range of 6-8 months. The timing of receiving an immigrant visa after an interview can depend from consulate to consulate and is often a week after the interview. Once the applicant receives their immigrant visa they will pay an additional fee called the ELIS fee. This should be paid before the applicant enters the US. When the consulate issues the visa they also send out a sealed envelope. The applicant will take the unopened sealed envelope with the immigrant visa and will present that to the US CIS officer in the US. That officer will update the computer and stamp the passport. At that point the immigrant is a permanent resident of the US. The green card is only evidence of the status that has already been received. The card is sent in the mail often a month or so after entry into the US.
									One advantage of consular processing is that the timing is very predicable and is not often longer than that timeline. As opposed to adjustment of status, which can be 4 months but can be more than three years or longer on occasion, the consular processing timeline is very consistent.
									<br>
									It should be noted that for consular processing the applicant must maintain non-immigrant visa status until they leave the US to have their immigrant interview. An applicant can travel freely in and out of the United States so long as their current non-immigrant visa allows it, but the only time the benefit of this application accrues to an applicant is after the applicant returns as permanent resident. So, for example, an O-1 visa holder who has not yet been scheduled for their final interview may be faced with either extending their O1 visa in the US to maintain their status, or, in some instances, leaving the US to obtain one more O1 visa even though they might to scheduled for their immigrant visas a few months later. Under that scenario, an applicant can choose to move their immigrant visa interview at a later date, such as 6 months later.
									<br>
									Medical Exam: If the applicant is filing by adjustment of status they must have a medical exam from a Civil Surgeon on the approved list of USCIS. The medical exam will make sure the applicant is healthy and does not have an infectious disease. The doctor will give the applicant inoculations unless they can prove that they have already received the inoculations on the US CIS list.
									<br>
									If the applicant applies for consular processing the medical exam must take place before the interview. Depending upon the applicant’s travel plans they would need to have the medical exam on a prior trip to their country or they will need to travel to the country with enough time to process the medical exam before the interview.
